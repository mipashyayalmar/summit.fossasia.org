## Description / Changes

Title: iPad and iPad Pro Resolution Fix for Page Responsiveness

Description: This GitHub repository addresses the issue of page responsiveness on iPad and iPad Pro devices, with a specific focus on resolutions of 1024x1366 and 768x1024. The identified problem, labeled as Issue #2, highlighted inconsistencies in page display on these devices. As a first-time contributor, I took the initiative to investigate and resolve this issue, aiming for a 100% fix.

My approach involved thorough testing and debugging to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes. After implementing the solution, I personally verified its effectiveness by checking the website on affected devices. I am confident that the resolution I provided effectively tackles the problem and enhances user experience on iPads and iPad Pros.

I believe this contribution will be valuable to the FOSSASIA group and its contributors. I eagerly await feedback from maintainers and fellow contributors, welcoming suggestions for further improvements. Your input will help refine this solution and contribute to the overall enhancement of the project.
